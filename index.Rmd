## Course Description:
Whether you’re building software or shaping social systems, the essence of computing lies in thoughtful problem-solving. Design Thinking brings this ethos to life through a human-centered, systems-aware, and community-driven lens. In this course, students from all disciplines will learn to approach problems in the world around them with curiosity, empathy, and a passion to build and iterate.

Through a hands-on practicum structure, we will explore the full design thinking cycle: empathizing with users, defining meaningful problems, generating ideas, prototyping tangible solutions, and reflecting critically. Our work will focus on creating personally meaningful, community-centered interventions that demonstrate how even small design choices can contribute to resilience, accessibility, and positive change.

_No prerequisites, and all levels of prior technical experience are welcome — just bring your curiosity, courage, and a commitment to learning by doing._

## Learning Goals:
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
 - Apply the phases of human-centered design to open-ended challenges.
 - Build rapid prototypes to explore ideas and learn through making.
 - Engage generously in interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge-sharing.
 - Reflect critically on iteration, failure, resilience, and ethical design.
 - Communicate design processes and outcomes clearly to diverse audiences.
 - Understand design within broader societal, cultural, and systemic contexts.
