## Course Description:
Modern computing evolves at a rapid pace, with new methods, tools, and sociotechnical practices emerging all the time. This course offers an adaptable, rotating exploration of contemporary developments in computing that have significant technical, societal, or interdisciplinary impact. In Spring 2026, the course will examine how digital security is evolving across hardware, software, and human-centered systems, with an emphasis on how failures in practice often emerge from design choices, organizational processes, and human behavior rather than technical flaws alone. Interactive simulations, structured adversarial scenarios, and guided analysis anchor the course’s examination of how systems are stressed, defended, and redesigned under real-world constraints. _No prior coding or security background required._

## Learning Goals:
By the end of the course, students will be able to:

 - Explain foundational ideas underlying contemporary digital security.
 - Apply computational ways of thinking to security scenarios.
 - Analyze failures arising from interactions between technology and people.
 - Evaluate tradeoffs in real-world security systems.
 - Communicate analyses through written, visual, or simulated artifacts.
 - Work collaboratively on open-ended problems.
 - Synthesize perspectives from multiple disciplines.
