## Context

You are part of a small campus office that manages student-facing services such as advising appointments, basic forms, and informal records. Over time, the office has built a lightweight system intended to “make things easier” for both staff and students.

The system was created organically, without formal IT involvement, and has become part of daily operations.

## What You Know

- The system is a shared Google Sheet linked from the office website.

- Students sign up for appointments by entering:
   - their name
   - their student ID number<br/><br/>

- The link is public: anyone with the link can view and edit the sheet.

- The link is not widely advertised, but it is not access-controlled.

- Staff rely on the sheet daily and check it frequently.

- The sheet appears to contain only:
   - names
   - ID numbers
   - appointment times
   - brief appointment notes<br/><br/>
   
- There is:
   - no authentication
   - no access control
   - no logging or change history reviewed in practice

## Your Task

As a group, conduct a threat assessment of this system. Specifically:

 - Identify the assets worth protecting <br/>
_(Remember: assets may include people, time, trust, or institutional processes—not just “data.”)_

 - Identify plausible threat actors and their likely motivations<br/>
_(Malicious, careless, curious, bored, opportunistic, etc.)_

 - Identify plausible ways the system could be misused or fail<br/>
_(Focus on realistic scenarios, not exotic hacks.)_

 - Identify the most important risks, distinguishing between:
   - what is most severe if it happens
   - what is most likely to happen<br/><br/>
   
- Propose practical mitigations that:
   - reduce risk meaningfully
   - do not significantly disrupt staff workflows

## Deliverable

Be prepared to share:

 - Three risks you would worry about most (with a brief explanation)
 
 - Three mitigations you would implement first (with a brief explanation)
 
 - One assumption your group made that could change the analysis
