## Context

You are consulting for a small research lab that works with regulated or sensitive data and takes security seriously. The lab has invested in technical controls and formal processes to protect its systems.

From the outside, the system appears well-designed and professionally managed.

## What You Know

- All data is stored on a secured internal server.

- Access requires:
   - campus VPN
   - individual user credentials
   - multi-factor authentication (MFA)<br/><br/>

- Permissions are role-based and reviewed annually.

- System logs are collected and periodically audited.

- Backups are encrypted and stored offsite.

- The lab has a documented incident response plan.

- Graduate students and research assistants rotate in and out of the lab frequently.

- Lab members often work:
  - late at night
  - from home
  - on personal laptops<br/><br/>

- For convenience, people sometimes share results or intermediate outputs via:
  - email
  - Slack
  - other informal channels<br/><br/>

## Your Task

As a group, conduct a threat assessment of this system. Specifically:

 - Identify the assets worth protecting<br/>
_(Consider data, people, research integrity, compliance, and institutional trust.)_

 - Identify plausible threat actors<br/>
_(External attackers, insiders, compromised insiders, accidental misuse, etc.)_

 - Identify plausible attack paths or failure modes<br/>
_(Pay attention to how real work gets done.)_

 - Identify the most important risks, distinguishing between:
   - what is most severe
   - what is most likely<br/><br/>

- Propose practical mitigations that:
   - improve security
   - do not halt or seriously degrade research work<br/><br/>

## Deliverable

Be prepared to share:

 - Three risks you would worry about most (with a brief explanation)
 - Three mitigations you would implement first (with a brief explanation)
 - One assumption your group made that could change the analysis
